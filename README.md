# 🦾 Project Gradus  

## 🧠 Vision
> **Ad Gradus — Toward the next step in robotics.**  
>  
> Project Gradus goes beyond simple locomotion technology to capture the evolutionary journey toward robots that can balance and walk on their own.

## 🧭 Overview
**Project Gradus** is an open-source project that publishes various robots developed during my research journey.  
It records each **“Gradus” (Latin for *step*)** in the transition  
from **rolling machines** to **self-walking robots**.

Under the goal of **Ad Gradus** — “toward a step” — this project explores and experiments with the evolution of robotic mobility.  
By integrating **mechanical design**, **control**, and **intelligent learning**,  
it aims to reach the moment when a robot can **balance itself and take its own first step**.

## ⚙️ About the Project
Project Gradus releases the robots I personally design and build,  
making them reproducible both in **real-world hardware** (via 3D printing)  
and in **simulation environments** (using Gazebo).

- 🧩 Provides 3D-printable CAD/STL files for physical fabrication  
- 🧠 Includes ROS 2-based control code and Gazebo simulation setups  
- 🔁 Maintains consistency between hardware and simulation behavior  

Currently, the open-source release focuses on **wheeled robots**,  
but as my research advances, I plan to develop and publish **legged robots** capable of autonomous walking.  

This project is **independent of my career or affiliation**,  
and serves purely as a **research-driven journey to design, share, and learn through robotic evolution**.
